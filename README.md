# devopsfetch

## Overview

`devopsfetch` is a tool for DevOps that collects and displays system information, including active ports, user logins, Nginx configurations, Docker images, and container statuses. It also supports continuous monitoring with log rotation.

## Features

- Display all active ports and services.
- List Docker images and containers.
- Display Nginx domains and their ports.
- List all users and their last login times.
- Display activities within a specified time range.
- Log activities to a file with log rotation and management.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Nginx

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Maxidonx/DevOps-Fetch.git
   cd DevOps-Fetch
   ```

# File Structure
```
.
├── devopsfetch.service  # User as a pointer to the insatallion file
├── devopsfetch.sh       # Main script for fetching system information
├── install.sh           # Installation script for setting up dependencies and systemd service
└── README.md            # Project documentation

```
# Log Management
Logs generated by devOpsfetch are stored in ```/tmp/devopsfetch.log``` as well as ```/var/log/devopsfetch.log``` . You can view the log file using commands like ```cat```, ```less```, or ```tail```. For long-term storage and analysis, consider setting up log rotation using logrotate. with a maximum size of 10MB. Log rotation is handled automatically by renaming the old log file to `devopsfetch.log.old`
